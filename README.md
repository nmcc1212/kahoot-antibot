Kahoot AntiBot
==============

This script uses a "Levenshtein distance" formula, this compares usernames to determine similarity, taken from [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10473745/compare-strings-javascript-return-of-likely) DISCLAIMER: this wont work if all the bots have completely different usernames, but most bots just do bot-1, bot-2 etc.

How to improve anti-botting:
----------------------------

Sometimes, just an antibot is not enough... Here are ways to prevent bots from joining your games to the best of your ability

1.  **Enable Friendly Names** - This brings out the most power of the antibot, blocking 99% of bots. (until someone realized how to bypass this)
2.  **Enable 2FA** - Many bots try to brute force this. The AntiBot detects this and can block them.
3.  **Enable Team Mode** - While team mode no longer prevents most bots from joining, it can help filter out some bots that use the same patters for teams. Some bots may still not support team mode, so this will help.
